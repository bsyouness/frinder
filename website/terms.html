        <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using Frinder ("the app"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Frinder is a mobile application that uses augmented reality to display the relative positions of your friends and world landmarks. The app requires access to your device's location, motion sensors, and an internet connection to function.</p>

        <h2>Account</h2>
        <p>You must sign in with a valid Google account to use Frinder. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activity that occurs under it.</p>

        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app to stalk, harass, or monitor anyone without their consent</li>
            <li>Attempt to access another user's location without being mutually connected as friends</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the app</li>
            <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Location Sharing</h2>
        <p>Frinder shares your location only with users you have mutually added as friends. You can stop sharing your location at any time by revoking location permissions in your device settings or by removing friends from the app.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Frinder is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee the accuracy of location data, landmark positions, or the availability of the service. Do not rely on Frinder for navigation or safety-critical purposes.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Frinder and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Frinder at any time, for any reason, without notice.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
